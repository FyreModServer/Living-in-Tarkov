# Living-in-Tarkov
A single player, gameplay overhaul offering an Escape from Tarkov campaign and an experience like never before.
Created Feb 23, 2023

As I work to create this repo please refer to my (~25% completed) Discord channel for a better understanding. You can leave the Discord after reading up on it as that's entirely your prerogative, but my current pre-roadmap for this git is

1 Create Road map and start working on private roadmap for team members
2 Replace this readme with a proper one.
3 Get all info that shall be posted in this repo onto the Discord first, starting by formatting and making better effort in reducing the longevity of explaining what the mod is and what it does and why you and/or other EFT(Escape from Tarkov) player's might be interested in the project.
4 FIND TEAM MEMBERS BEFORE ALL MY MOTIVATION HAS DISSIPATED SO THAT I DON'T JUST ABANDON 10 MONTHS OF WORK. So if you would like to be on the team, I am looking for a variety of positions, some imminently and other's later on (like #3 for example - but until the discord has members/I announce the mod and show it off, it will help me better get to know why you want the discord mod position specifically and why LIT is something which interests you.

That is all as of 07:49 gmt+8, Feb 23, 2023.
